### Project Title
Udacitiy Version Control

### Description
The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers
Changes in Python script after Review by Udacity:
create a new function, for example, called display_data. You need to ask the user whether he wants to see 5 rows of data. We will show all parts of the analysis then we will ask this question: Do you want to see 5 rows of data. But it is not only the first 5 data but as much as the user wants. For example, you asked the user like this in the first step: "Do you want to see the first 5 rows of data?". He typed yes, and you will show the first 5 rows, then you ask again, " Do you want to see the next 5 rows of data?" then he says yes, and you show the next 5 data. You need to keep asking until the user enters “no”.
Changes 2 in Python file: # display the most frequent combination of start station and end station trip
